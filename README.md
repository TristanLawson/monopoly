# monopoly
automated version of monopoly to be used with a board (in-person game, computerized rules)

Current:
- fully operational game with chance deck, properties, and cash-transaction methods

Next steps:
- create list of commands in README
- split into modules
- add game modes with different parameters (ex. less starting cash)
---> perhaps import different init functions depending on the mode?
